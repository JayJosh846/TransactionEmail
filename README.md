You see we all have problems, flaws, no one is perfect. Luckily for you, as much as you have yours, you are not alone so I cannot blame you for some decisions you have made so far. Your own problem however is that you are too spiritual, always longing to draw ever closer to God and to be the best that you can be, spiritually. However in the process, you miss out on the little things or people that God draws in your way, simply because you are not fully convinced that they are even from God in the first place and that you believe are just fine fellowshiping with God. 

Again, I wouldn't blame you for thinking that way. No one likes to be cheated or disappointed at the end. Another problem of yours is that your walk with God sometimes makes you not to see reality for what it really is - broken, flawed, imperfect beings only striving to be better in whatever they do. 

You say you are not convinced, till now I don't fully know what you mean by that because you didn't expansiate on those words. But my guess is that you meant, your expectations of my walk with God wasn't attained and that you didn't think you were ready to commit yourself further to something not established or proven. Again, it's fine, I get that. No one wants to be disappointed in the end. But I think I need to just remind you of what and where you were before you attained your current level. Sometimes, you flawed, and "fell" (You still do anyway, but you know better.) You see, it's called life - we continue to pick ourselves up and try again when we fall and when we fail. We don't let our doubts, and uncertainties cloud our hopes for the future we want for ourselves. In fact, sometimes we take chances, reasnable chances however. 

Now I've given you more than enough reason to take a reasnalbe chance with me. I'm not asking you to wait till I'm a perfect being, and you are convinced, because I can never be that! No one can! Not even you! We only take chances, reasonable, calculated chances with people!  The same thing with a start-up business. You don't know what will befall the business in the future, but you are willing to invest (take a chance) in it because you trust yourself and the business enough to yield positive returns. Your investment is coming as a result of proper research carried out in the market. You don't just invest for investment sake. In the end, you don't give up on the business just because it's not returning the required profit when it's still in its early stages.

I know I'm the one who always seem to show weakness by crying for help. Well, I do that not because I'm weak but because I'm humble enough to realise that as a man, a human being, we were created in two's and not alone. That speaks enough volume. 

You may feel like you are emotionally tougher and that you can be fine alone (haven't you just been fine?), but you need help too. You were created to be be in cohesive companionship with someone who would love and care for you enough! Don't let your sense of independence deceive you that you can be fine alone. You need help too. The Bible is pretty clear according to - Ecclesiastes 4:9-10. You cannot get there on your own, you need God and human involvement. Who better to be humble and submit to? 

You started something beautiful, something wonderful 2 years ago. I admit, you may have not wanted to start any commitments and I don't blame you for thinking that way because I know you so well to be someone who -

- only wants to serve God and have no time for any distractive, unmeaningful, spiritually unproductive relationships especially with an unlike-minded person
- knows the typical nature of a boy to be deceiteful and wayward.
- has the knowledge of having a fragile and innocent heart and wouldn't give that away to just any boy especially with the reality in the previous point.

As a considerate and trustful person, however you were willing to listen and give me a chance. Fast forward to two years later, honestly I've been a good boy with you. I've behaved If I'm to review that chance given me, I would say that I did not betray or abuse the opportunity. You cannot deny that I actually proved your expections about me wrong.

With this chance, I became a better person, I developed in my character and my spirituality. I took the best advantage of the chance.
I was a good boy, I cared about you as a friend, I gave you everything, my time, my energy, my resources, my commitements to ensuring your betterment and growth of our friendship. 

As a way to prove to you my allegience with God and to be a serious person, I gave up a lot. I purged myself of my previous lifestyle. I cut contacts with friends, I cut hold habbits off just to fully ensure that I was on track with my walk with God and the commitments of my friendship with you. 

At the same time, I told you my intentions, my desires and aspirations particularly with service with God. I also was open, sincere and unashamed to tell you about my short-comings. And I told you I needed help, particularly in that regard to accomplish all of that. 

I envisioned a formidable and strong partnership with you, one that would serve God and see that only His name was glorified

The foundations of our relationship, was strong. So strong that it has proven almost impossible to dissolve so far. So strong that, life without you became so foriegn and I've only continued to struggle living in such a life so far.
What we had was special

But this writing is not about me or my emotions or my affections towards you. It is about God, and a service to Him. It is His name alone that would be glorified at the end of the day. 

With your help, as a member of the body of Christ, I was able to commence a meaningful and a solid relationship with God. And almost immediately I realised His calling for my life (One that you are very aware of). Thank God that you reached out to me in the first place. You listened to His voice. I was right there living my life but He sent you to me. And the reason and purpose of why He did that, would be accomplised. There is no going back from that.

I saw you as a worthy partner with your personality and level of commitments to the course of Christ and I envisioned a future with you as a formidable partner who could help continue to proclaim the name of Christ in the world.

Now, the intent of this writing, is to again bring the proposal to you. Again, this is not about me, or about you or about my affections towards you. It is about the work of God that MUST and WILL be done. I'm calling you to continue your partnership with me in this great and wonderful course that started two years ago to continue to ensure that the church of God matches on. 

But know that God's work will be done, with or without me. I know what God did for me in my life and I made a vow to proclaim Him to the world as long as I lived.  I can only advise and hope that you don't let doubts, insecurites and uncertainties cloud up your mind and deny you of a wonderful life God has for you with someone who truly cares about you and would do anything to ensure your development and success in life. Like I told you earlier, no one is perfect. But you are only willing to give yourself and heart to someone who you believe would handle it well no matter the situation.

I said it before, I'm saying again, I'm willing to give you space and time, as much as you need. If there's one thing we have both had within the last 2 months, it is time to ourselves. Go, pray to God, let God guild your heart and teach you the way to go. But you also need to know that God expects you to use your sense, He gave us that for a reason too.
